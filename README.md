# CuerdOS Icon theme

This is the official icon theme for CuerdOS.

It is based on "Elementary-xfce" [https://github.com/shimmerproject/elementary-xfce] which in turn is based on "Elementary-project" [https://elementary.io/]

This fork has been made to mark the corporate colors of CuerdOS to the icon pack; in addition to the fact that the images of these icons have been converted to the indexed color model, with the aim of following the philosophy of this distribution.

## Instalation guide:
(in debian based distros)

```
sudo dpkg -i cuerdos-icon-theme
```

### (With administrator privileges)
Drag the "CuerdOS-Elementary" folder to the "/usr/share/icons" directory

### (No admin privileges)
Drag the "CuerdOS-Elementary" folder to the "/home/[your user]/.icons" directory

If the ".icons" folder does not exist, you just have to create it.
